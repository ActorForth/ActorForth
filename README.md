Run `./setup` under a python 3.8+ virtual environment for best results.

Then run `./interpret samples/fundamentals01.a4` to see it run a simple
script.

Run `./interpret` by itself to get the REPL.

See [ActorForthDefinition](docs/ActorForthDefinition.md) for a quick
overview of how the language works.

Experiments implementing an Actor-style programming language on top of
a stack-based processor will be forthcoming as the system is
developed.
