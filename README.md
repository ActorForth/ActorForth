ActorForth was originally written in Python 3.x but hit some technical limits in Python's ability to do low level processing and the alternative implementation stressed the "functional" iterative aspects of the Python interpreter so we have now switched to modern C++ and are back on track.

See [ActorForthDefinition](docs/ActorForthDefinition.md) for a quick
overview of how the language works.

Experiments implementing an Actor-style programming language on top of
a stack-based processor will be forthcoming as the system is
developed.
