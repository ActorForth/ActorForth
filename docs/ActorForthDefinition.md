# ActorForth Definition

## Overview

ActorForth is an environment, compiler, interpreter, and program combined into one.
Outside of a small number of primitives, two (presently one) stacks, and its interpreter, there is no inherent syntax for ActorForth.
The execution environment is a concatenative, stack based, strongly typed language that can be easily extended to build domain specific languages (DSLs).
All human/computer interaction starts via the interpreter/compiler REPL. From entries
